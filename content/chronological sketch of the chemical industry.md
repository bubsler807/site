(1777) Lavoisier's _Traité Élémentaire de Chimie_ outlines the Law of Conservation of Mass, considered to be the first modern chemical textbook.

(1828) Jean-Baptiste Guimet creates synthetic ultramarine

(1828) Friedrich Wöhler synthesizes urea from ammonium cyanate—starting point of modern organic chemistry—blurs lines between organic and inorganic

(1856) _Perkin's Mauv_ - William Henry Perkin accidentally discovers *mauveine* a purple dye derived from _aniline_, a coal tar byproduct, and marked a significant breakthrough in the chemical industry by enabling mass-produced synthetic colors for textiles. First mass produced synthetic dye.

(1876) *Methylene Blue* - Originally intended to be a dye, it has been described as "the first fully synthetic drug used in medicine." Methylene blue continued to be used in the second World War, where it was not well-liked by soldiers, who observed, "Even at the loo, we see, we pee, navy blue"

(1907) Leo Baekeland invents *Bakelite*, the first synthetic plastic. Replaces *Hemacite* (compressed blood and sawdust).

(1938) Wallace Carothers and DuPont develop nylon, the first synthetic fiber, which becomes a substitute for silk and has important military and consumer applications during WWII.

Mass production of petrochemical synthetic polymers... *polyethylene*, *polystyrene*, and *polyester* leads to widespread use of plastics in everyday life.

(1960s) Pop artists like Andy Warhol incorporate synthetic materials into their art in a meta-referential way.

(1973) First genetically modified organism is created by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen

(1974) first genetically modified animal, a mouse, created by Rudolf Jaenisch

(1982) First Genetically Modified crop, an antibiotic-resistant tobacoo plant. China was the first country to commercialize transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992.

(1983) First genetically engineered plant developed by Michael W. Bevan, Richard B. Flavell and Mary-Dell Chilton. Tobacco...

(1994) Calgene attained approval to commercially release the *Falvr Savr* tomato, the first genetically modified food.
